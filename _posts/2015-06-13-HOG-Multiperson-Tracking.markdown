Multitracking person in real scenes is a big challenge in the Computer Vision field given its multiple applications such as as surveillance systems, robotics, pedestrian safety, marketing, etc. in addition to the inherent challenges such as the complexity of the scene, changes in lighting, and the crowd of people that leads to the presence of occlusions withint the video.

The aim of the research is to develop a approach based on Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for multi-person tracking based on video. To validate the accuracy and precision of the opproach, it will evaluate with a set public data and a new set of own data.
